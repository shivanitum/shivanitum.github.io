    <p >So, what about me? Ok, I'll start by introducing myself. My name is Sivani Tumuluri. 
        I am a passionate reader and my favorite genres are thriller, mystery.
        I am results oriented, constantly checking in with the goal to determine 
        how close or how far away I am and what it will take to make it happen. I graduated with Btech in Computer Science Engineering earlier this year. 
        I am working as an intern at Zemoso Technologies at present. That's all  I have to share about me, you could tell me something about you in the contact me page 
        by writing a message!</p>
